@dataclass
class ChannelData(Serializable):
    """
    UFF class that contains all the information needed to store and later process channel data.

    Notes:

    The parameter authors identifies the authors of the data; description describes the acquisition scheme, motivation and application;
    local_time and country_code identify the time and place the data were acquired; system describes the hardware used in the acquisition;
    sound_speed contains the reference speed of sound that was used in the system to produce the transmitted waves;
    and repetition_rate is the sequence repetition rate, also referred to as framerate in some scenarios.

    The object uff.channel_data contains all the probes used in the acquisition, a list of the unique_waves that have been transmitted,
    and a list of the unique_events that form the sequence. The sequence is specified as an array of uff.timed_events, each member
    containing a reference to an event, and the time_offset since the beginning of the current repetition, also known as frame.

    The HDF5 dataset data contains the channel data, organized as a matrix of dimensions (HDF5 notation), :

    [frames x events x channels x samples]

    where samples is the number of temporal samples acquired by the system, channels is the number of active channels, unique_events
    is the number of events in the sequence (not unique events), and repetitions is the number of times the described sequence was repeated.
    Notice that "HDF5 uses C storage conventions, assuming that the last listed dimension is the fastest-changing dimension and the
    first-listed dimension is the slowest changing." (https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/UG/12_Dataspaces.html).
    This means that by accessing the data with MATLAB's HDF5 API or Python's h5py the dimension order will be:

    [samples x channels x events x frames]

    This proposal has the limitation of requiring that all event acquisitions have the same number of time samples and active channels
